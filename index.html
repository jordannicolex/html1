				<h2>My name is Jordan Lopez</h2>
			</header>
			<p>
			I'm 25 years old who just recently graduated from UTSA with a degree in Communications with a concentration in Public Relations. While I was at UTSA I worked with UTSA Athletics where I got to write my own article that is featured on the website, transcribed post game quotes during the week and after games and so much more. My dream job is to work for a hockey team and do things in the media relations or social media department

					<h2>Hobbies</h2>
		
			<p>
			Some hobbies of mine include shopping,hanging out with friends and family, reading, watching Netflix or Hulu (my favorite shows include Brooklyn Nine Nine, Parks and Recreation, The Office, New Girl and so much more) but when I'm not watching Netflix and Hulu you'll find me watching Youtube and my favorite Youtuber is David Dobrik (which by the way you should totally watch his videos and subscribe)

			My favorite drink from Starbucks is a Green Tea Lemonade. I'm a Gryffindor (but sometimes I feel like I'm also very Hufflepuff).My favorite season is hockey season (and fall) and my favorite holiday is Christmas. My favorite animal is a Penguin and my faovite hockey teams are the Pittsburgh Penguins, St Louis Blues, Toronto Maple Leafs and Dallas Stars. My favorite hockey players are Sidney Crosby and Auston Matthews. I've seen the Pittsburgh Penguins over 11 times in Dallas. I can quote all the Harry Potter movies.
