				<h2>My name is Jordan Lopez</h2>
			</header>
			<p>
			I'm 25 years old who just recently graduated from UTSA with a degree in Communications with a concentration in Public Relations. While I was at UTSA I worked with UTSA Athletics where I got to write my own article that is featured on the website, transcribed post game quotes during the week and after games and so much more. I am also working UTSA Football games this season as part of the Media Services for UTSA Athletics. My dream job is to work for a hockey team and do things in the media relations or social media department. I am a season ticket holder for the San Antonio Rampage and I've been a season ticket holder for the last 9 or so years. I've recently gotten hired to become part of the Game Crew for the 2019-2020 Rampage Hockey season and I'm excited to get my foot into the door.

					<h2>Hobbies</h2>
		
			<p>
			Some hobbies of mine include shopping, hanging out with friends and family, reading, watching Netflix or Hulu. My favorite shows include Brooklyn Nine Nine, Parks and Recreation, The Office, New Girl and more. When I'm not watching Netflix and Hulu you'll find me watching Youtube and my favorite Youtuber is David Dobrik (which by the way you should totally watch his videos and subscribe). I love David and his content because he is one of the most genuine and caring youtubers I've ever watched. He does so many amazing things for his friends, family and even strangers such as giving away cars, macbooks, money to help pay for tution. His content is some of the best on Youtube in my opinion.

				<h2>Random Facts about Me</h2>

			<p>
			My favorite drink from Starbucks is a Green Tea Lemonade but in the fall I love Salted Caramel Mocha Frappuccino. I'm a Gryffindor but sometimes I feel like I'm also very Hufflepuff.My favorite season is hockey season (and fall) and my favorite holiday is Christmas. My favorite animal is a Penguin and my favorite hockey teams are the Pittsburgh Penguins, St Louis Blues, Toronto Maple Leafs and Dallas Stars. My favorite hockey players are Sidney Crosby, Auston Matthews, Jake Guentzel, Olli Maatta, Sammy Blais, William Nylander and more. I've seen the Pittsburgh Penguins over 11 times in Dallas but it will be 12 in October. I can quote all the Harry Potter movies from start to finish.
